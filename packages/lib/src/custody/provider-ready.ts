/**
 * provider-ready.ts
 *
 * Reports whether an external custody/payments provider is configured and
 * operational. Today only the InternalLedgerCustodyProvider exists — a real,
 * database-backed ledger that records transactions but has no connection to any
 * external payment rail or blockchain network.
 *
 * UI components use this to show truthful empty states (e.g. "Crypto deposits
 * are not enabled until a configured provider assigns an address") rather than
 * rendering actions that cannot execute.
 *
 * When a real external provider is integrated (Fireblocks, Copper, a bank
 * SWIFT/ACH adapter, etc.), that integration should register itself here using
 * the environment variables listed below.
 *
 * Never import this file from client components — server only.
