# Neptlium Systems

> **Institutional Capital Operating System**

Neptlium Systems is an institutional-grade capital operating system engineered to provide secure, governed, and intelligent infrastructure for professional investors, capital allocators, family offices, treasury teams, investment firms, and digital asset operators.

The platform is designed as institutional infrastructure — not a retail investment application.

Neptlium provides a unified operating environment for managing, monitoring, allocating, and governing digital and traditional capital through secure technology infrastructure.

# Engineering Philosophy

Every engineering decision must reinforce four principles:

## Infrastructure Before Investment

Build reliable systems before financial products.

## Governance Before Growth

Security, controls, and accountability come before scale.

## Intelligence Before Marketing

Build useful intelligence and operational capability before promotional growth.

## Trust Before Conversion

Institutional confidence is the foundation of adoption.

# Repository Architecture

Neptlium is a **Turborepo monorepo** containing independently deployable applications sharing common packages, design systems, domain libraries, and a unified Supabase backend.
